# Deep-Learning-based-Pneumonia-Detection-Using-Chest-X-Ray-Images-

To reproduce results:

1. Download Chest X-Ray dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia 
2. Import all necessary libraries
3. Specify local path to dataset
4. Open ResNet-18Trained.ipynb
5. Run both models (ResNet-18 with randomly initialized weights and ResNet-18 with ImageNet initialized weights)

It is highly suggested to run the notebook utilizing a GPU.
